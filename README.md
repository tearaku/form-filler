## Objectives / Roadmap
Quick checklist of things to be done, more will be added later
- [x] User profile page
    - [] Refactor: use spread syntax for fields that do not require post-processing (code looks nicer that way XD)
- [] API Routes
    - [] Refactor: standardize responses -> to contain data (if any) & message for frontend to display status (success / error / etc.)
- [x] Event creation
    - [] Minor issue: field arrays -> requires multiple submit-clicks before they're registered as "inputted"
- [] Event registration (as non-hosts)
- [] Add FAQ / help instructions (on ALL pages!)
